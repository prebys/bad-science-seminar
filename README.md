# bad-science-seminar
Repository for Science: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

This is is a one credit first year seminar, created by Prof. Eric Prebys at UC Davis, and first taught in Fall 2025, as FRS-003-009.

The Canvas site has been exported to the Canvas Export directory, and split into smaller files so github can handle it.  Instructions for reconstituting it can be found in the AAAREADME.txt file.
