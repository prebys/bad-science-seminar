Professor Prebys received a BS in Engineering Physics from the University of Arizona in 1984 and a PhD in Experimental Particle Physics from the University of Rochester in 1990. After a postdoctoral position at CERN, in Geneva Switzerland, he was an assistant professor at Princeton University.  In 2001, he started work at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), near Chicago, IL, with a focus on the physics of particle accelerators.  In 2017, he came to UC Davis to serve as professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and as Director of Crocker Nuclear Laboratory.

He has always had an interest in outreach in education.  He has taught several times at the Department of Energy US Particle Accelerator School (USPAS), as well as starting the Lee Teng Undergraduate Internship and running if for 10 years.  He has given public talks on a variety of topics.  Of particular relevance to the this course is the lecture "Energy: no Such Thing as a Free Lunch", which focuses on "free energy" scams.
